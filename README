## general overview of the system
The two programs combined allow user to load a collection from a json file and perform operations on the
loaded collection.
The first program “load-json.py”, requires two arguments to run: the input file name and the connected
MongoDB port number. The input file needs to be in the same directory.

Once the collection is load, the second program provides a command line UI for user to perform 4
operations on the loaded collection. User will be prompt to select the given menu by entering the
corresponding index in the command line.
